					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>I am currently a sophomore majoring in Information Science and minoring in business at Cornell University.
						I discovered the world of UX design right before I started college and immediately became fascinated. Since delving in, I have been seeking opportunities to design for all different types of projects, ranging from healthcare to fashion. I am always seeking to learn new things whether that's improving my visual design techniques or learning about business needs. In my freetime, I enjoy drawing, dancing, and thrifting.</p>
