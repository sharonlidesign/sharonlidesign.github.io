          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            UniPantry is a startup created by Cornell students. It serves to
             empower students to live healthy lifestyles, beginning with eating
              nutritious meals. As students ourselves, we understand the struggle
               to eat nutritiously while staying within money and time constraints.
                I am currently working with the product managers to design and launch
                 the first iteration of the mobile app.

    <!-- Problem and Solution -->

      <div class="two-column">

        <div class="column-1">
          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <h6>
            Millions of college students who live off-campus want to eat
             healthy, fulfilling meals, but cannot because of time and
              budget constraints. 
          </h6>
        </div>

        <div class="placement">
          <!-- empty div -->
        </div>

        <div class="column-2">
          <h4>The Solution</h4>
          <h6>
            The UniPantry app helps students plan and cook their own
             meals based on their budget and nutrition requirements,
              while learning money and time saving skills along the way. 
          </h6>

    <!-- Prototyping -->
    <section>

      <h4>Prototyping Iterations</h4>

      <h6>
        After designing an initial prototype, I made changes to the
         app based on feedback from my fellow designer, product manager,
          and users.
      </h6>

      <h5>Improving the Visual Hierarchy of the Grocery List</h5>

      <h6>
        In order to make the Grocery List more visually consistent,
         I decided to remove the pictures of food. Although they make the
          page more exciting to look at, I discovered that they do not make
           a difference in the user’s understanding and add a layer of
            difficulty for our software team. I also decided to extend the
             grocery categories to cover the width of the screen, in order
              to make the visual separation of the category sections more
               clear. The labeling of the different categories are important
                to users because it helps them efficiently shop at different
                 sections of the grocery store, one at a time.  
      </h6>

        <img src="content/unipantry/grocerylist_before_after.png" alt="Grocery List Before and After" />
      </div>

      <h5>Making Grocery List Intuitive to Edit</h5>

      <h6>
        To make the deleting affordance more intuitive, I changed the
         checking action to a left-swiping action instead. This also helps
          the user not get confused about which side of the grocery card to
           click when checking off an item. 
      </h6>

      </div>

      <h5>Improving the Accessibility of Recipe Filtering</h5>

      <h6>
        I redesigned the filter function to be more suited to the
         mobile screen, enlarging the selection area while conserving
          space and clearly indicating the state of the filter.

      <h4>Web Design</h4>

      <h6>
        Besides the mobile app, I also worked with the marketing team
         to design and write content for an inviting launch website.

      <h4>Post Project</h4>

      <h5>What’s Next?</h5>

      <h6>
        UniPantry plans to launch the first version of the app in Fall 2020.
         We plan to continue improving future versions of the app based on
          quantitative and qualitative user feedback. 
      </h6>

      <h5>Takeaways</h5>

      <h6>
        Through working in this startup, I’ve had the opportunity to
         improve my skills in rapid prototyping, making decisions based
          on business and software considerations, and creating quality
           work despite tight deadlines. I have really valued this
            opportunity to create a full mobile app with a cross-functional
             team.
