      <h4><strong>Role:</strong> Brand Designer</h4>
      <h4><strong>Tools:</strong> Adobe Photoshop</h4>
      <h4><strong>Duration:</strong> January to May 2019</h4>
      <p>I designed this branding guide to reflect the clubâ€™s new mission: to promote thrifting as a
        desirable alternative for exploring unconventional fashion trends and personal style, on top of its
        original mission of sustainability. I combined the vintage aesthetic that is associated with thrift
        stores with the currently trendy minimalist aesthetic to create a brand that is more
        attractive to college students. </p>
