          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Popcorn, previously Lunchable, is an early-stage startup that
             helps college students find friends and network by setting
              them up with people of similar interests. Throughout my
               time at Popcorn, I was directly involved in shaping its
                rebrand and launch as a web app that introduces people
                 to others by scheduling virtual group meetups.
                  I worked closely with a fellow UX designer as well as
                   the CEO to create the entire user experience from
                    conception to delivering the final prototype to the
                     engineering team.

      <div class="two-column">

        <div class="column-1">
          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <h6>College students want to make <strong>new friends</strong> online,
              however they feel anxious about potentially having
               awkward conversations or getting ignored due to <strong>not
                knowing the other people well enough</strong>.

             by facilitating <strong>high-participation in group meetups</strong>, building a sense
              of <strong>commonality</strong> early-on, and <strong>removing barriers</strong> in starting conversations.

      <h4>User Research</h4>

      <h6>To better understand the target user,
         I interviewed 7 college-aged students with questions
          that allowed me to delve deeper into their motivations
           and specific emotions they have when using friend-matching
            services (e.g. Bumble, OkZoomer, etc.).

             it is difficult to find a “tangible connection” to talk about.

      <h4>Concept Development</h4>

      <h5>Mapping Out the Flow</h5>

      <h6>Before I started prototyping, I mapped out the task flow.
         I focused on ordering the actions in a way that is intuitive,
          yet it still guides the user enough to alter their behavior,
           namely increasing their likelihood to sign up and show up to
            a meetup.
      </h6>

      <div class="big-image">
        <img src="content/popcorn/info_hierarchy.png" alt="Task Flow" />
      </div>

      <h5>Finding the Right Approach</h5>

      <h6>After deciding the flow, I roughly sketched out what each
         feature would look like in order to explore how to approach
          them and organize them into pages that made sense to the user.

      <h4>Prototyping</h4>
      
      <!-- Meetup Explorations -->
      <h5>Influencing Users to Commit</h5>

      <h6>I focused a lot on the “Upcoming Meetup” page because it
         has the <strong>biggest impact</strong> on whether or not the user decides
          to go to a meetup. My main considerations were making sure
           the page introduces the user’s matches in a <strong>friendly, personal</strong>
            way while providing all the <strong>basic information</strong> such as the
             time and video call link. 
      </h6>

      <!-- Meetup Iteration 1 -->
      <div class="two-column text-image">

        <div class="column-1">
          <p><strong>Iteration 1</strong></p>
          <p>Little information on the initial page. User must click
             “View Details” to learn more about their matches and
              communicate with them via chat. Chat at the bottom of the
               “Details” page.

          <p>Similar to the first, but moved the chat to the top of the

              their matches before the meetup.

        </div>

      </div>

      <h6>
        I decided to go with the <strong>third iteration</strong> because it lets the
          user learn more about who they’re meeting right off the bat and
          encourages users to <strong>commit to going to the meetup immediately</strong>.
           It shows the chat in a way that gives the user an option to
            engage in it. It also lets the user see when someone else has
             confirmed, which encourages them to confirm as well. Overall,
              it is <strong>concise</strong> while still giving the user <strong>enough information
                to make them want to attend the meetup</strong>.
      </h6>
  
      <!-- Video Call Iterations -->

      <h5>Providing an Enjoyable Meetup Experience</h5>

      <h6>
        Another important page was the video call interface.
         Given that many college students dread awkward conversations
          during first meetings, I wanted to incorporate some kind of
           conversation starter feature into the video call. Many users
            also expressed interest in this feature during usability
             testing.

      </div>

      <h6>
        I ended up with the <strong>third iteration</strong> because it gives users the
        <strong>option to get a convo starter</strong>, while <strong>not obstructing their view</strong> of
          the people they’re calling. Afterall, many users said that they
          would prefer to only see the other participants’s faces but like
            having the option to see the buttons if they so choose.

      <h4>Feedback & Usability Testing</h4>

      <h5>Fostering Meetup Participation</h5>

      <h6>
        After recieving feedback from my team, I decided to move the
        “Confirm Now” button and time to the center of the page, in order
          to make it more <strong>visible and prominent</strong>. This would encourage the
          user to click this button, thus furthering our number one goal
            of increasing meetup participation. I also changed the green
            checkmarks to text because users were confused about their
              meaning during usability testing. Now, users can <strong>clearly see
                which people are confirmed to attend the meetup</strong>, which would
                in turn encourage them to confirm as well. Finally, I made the
                chat notification red in order to make it stand out more, thus
                  encouraging users to click on it and <strong>engage with the chat</strong>.

      <h5>Reimagining How Users Connect with Past Meetups</h5>

      <h6>
        I initially designed this page to show a history of the user’s
        past meetups. After recieving feedback from my manager, I
          redesigned it into the “Chats” page replacing the meetup cards
          with chats. This would make it more accessible and <strong>effortless
            for users to engage with past meetup groups</strong>, thus furthering
            our goal of fostering engagement. I also removed the chatbox
              from the “Upcoming Meetup” page and instead put all chats in
              together in one page in order to create a more <strong>centralized
                place for users to talk to others</strong>. During testing, users
                also confirmed that this format makes them feel more
                  inclined to participate in the group chats.

    <h4>UI Designs</h4>

    <h5>Redesigning the Profile to be More Engaging</h5>

    <h6>
      I redesigned the profile page to take up more horizontal space,
       to let the user to <strong>see more info without scrolling</strong>. Taking up
        more horizontal space also allows users to immediately see the
         images at the bottom, which add the most personalized touch to
          the profile. Overall, the profile page plays a huge role in
           how users get to know each other before a meetup, so I really
            focused on making it <strong>expressive, yet standardized</strong>.

    <h5>Creating a More Delightful Experience</h5>

    <h6>
      I continued to make other changes to content, colors, and
       typography in order to create a clearer sense of hierarchy and
        visual consistency for the user. In particular, I redesigned the
         UI of the sign up pages to provide a more <strong>delightful experience</strong>
          that communicates a sense of <strong>fun and sociability</strong>.

    <!-- Takeaways -->
    <section>

      <h3>Takeaways</h3>

      <h6>
        Throughout this internship, I gained great insight into how to
        design for increased user engagement. An important design
          consideration for this app was to influence users to be more
          proactive and communicative to the people they meet online,
            so I designed with this goal in mind throughout the entire
            process. I also had a lot of practice communicating my
              design justifications to cross-functional team members
              and received a lot of feedback that helped me make the
                design more engaging and impactful.
