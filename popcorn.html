          <p>
            Popcorn, previously Lunchable, is an early-stage social-networking startup
             that helps college students make friends online. Throughout my time at
              Popcorn, I was directly involved in shaping the entire product development
               cycle of a web app that sets users up on group meetups with people of
                similar interests.

    <!-- User Research -->
    <section>

      <h4>User Research</h4>
      
      <h5>Receiving Initial Requirements</h5>
      <h6>
        The internal stakeholder, my manager, strongly emphasized that the main
         value proposition of the product was the fact that it sets up a time and
          (virtual) place for users to meet the people they match with, <strong>removing the
           friction</strong> of coordinating a meetup themselves.
      </h6>

      <h5>Conducting User Interviews</h5>
      <h6>
        In order to confirm the requirements given to me and discover new user
         needs, I decided to conduct a round of user research. I interviewed 5
          college students, ranging from freshmen to seniors. My goal for the study
           was to learn more about their experiences and preferences with finding
            friends in college, especially now that we’re all online.
      </h6>

      <h5>Synthesizing Interview Insights</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6>
            80% of interviewees said they <strong>feel awkward</strong> when meeting up with someone
             they met online.
          </h6>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>
            40% of interviewees think existing friend-matching apps are <strong>unreliable</strong>
             in that they don’t guarantee a user to actually meet up, virtually or in
              person, with their matches.
          </h6>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>
            60% of interviewees said they find it <strong>difficult to start conversations</strong>
             with someone new due to not knowing what to talk about. 
          </h6>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Refining the Requirements</h5>
      <h6>
        My research confirmed the value of setting up meetups for the user. I
         also noted that a big problem not addressed by the initial requirements was
          that users feel awkward when starting conversations with new people. Thus,
           I proposed that we address this problem to my manager and arrived at the
            following problem statement.

      <h5>Mapping Out the Flow</h5>

      <h6>Before I started prototyping, I mapped out the task flow.
         I focused on ordering the actions in a way that is intuitive,
          yet it still guides the user enough to alter their behavior,
           namely increasing their likelihood to sign up and show up to
            a meetup.

      <h5>Finding the Right Approach</h5>

      <h6>After deciding the flow, I roughly sketched out what each
         feature would look like in order to explore how to approach
          them and organize them into pages that made sense to the user.

        I decided to go with Iteration 3 because it allows users to get to know the
         other people at first glance, making their first impression more <strong>personable</strong>.

           about and communicate with their matches.

      <h5>Providing an Enjoyable Video Call Experience</h5>

      <h6>
        Given that 80% interviewees mentioned how much they dread awkward conversations
         during first meetings, I wanted to incorporate some kind of <strong>conversation starter</strong>
          into the video call. I created mid-fidelity prototypes and conducted
           usability-testing with 6 different college students. During this first round
            of usability testing, 4 out of 6 users mentioned that they would love this
             feature, further confirming that it is a valuable feature.
      </h6>

        I ended up choosing Iteration 3 because compared to the others, it best
         allows users to put their attention on the people they’re talking to, while

      <h5>Fostering Meetup Participation</h5>

        I asked users to go through the entire flow, giving them specific tasks along
         the way to observe their behavior. In addition to getting feedback from users,
          I also received feedback from my manager, and combined the feedback from both
           stakeholders to make the following changes:
      </h6>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Moved the “Confirm Now” button to a more <strong>visible and prominent position.</strong>
           This would encourage the user to click this button, thus furthering our
            number one goal of increasing meetup participation. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changed the green checkmarks to text because users were <strong>confused</strong> about
            their meaning during usability testing. Now, users can <strong>clearly see which
              people are confirmed</strong> to attend the meetup, which would in turn encourage
              them to confirm as well.

      <h5>Reimagining How Users Connect with Past Meetups</h5>

      <h6>
        I initially designed this page to show a history of the user’s past meetups,
         with each meetup represented with a card. After receiving feedback, I redesigned
          it with the following changes:
      </h6>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changed “Past Meetups” page into a “Chats” page replacing the meetup
            cards with chats. This would make it more accessible and <strong>effortless
             for users to engage with past meetup groups</strong>, thus furthering our goal of
              fostering engagement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Removed the chatbox from the “Upcoming Meetup” page and instead put all
            chats in together in one page in order to create a more <strong>centralized place
             for users to talk to others</strong>. During testing, users also confirmed that this
              format makes them feel more inclined to participate in the group chats. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h4>UI Designs</h4>

    <h5>Redesigning the Profile to be More Engaging</h5>

    <h6>
      I redesigned the profile page to take up more horizontal space, allowing users
       to see more in one glance. Overall, the profile page plays a huge role in how
        users get to know each other before a meetup, so I really focused on making it
         expressive yet standardized.

    <h5>Creating a More Delightful Experience</h5>

    <h6>
      I continued to make other changes to content, colors, and
       typography in order to create a clearer sense of hierarchy and
        visual consistency for the user. In particular, I redesigned the
         UI of the sign up pages to provide a more <strong>enjoyable experience</strong>
          that communicates a sense of <strong>fun and sociability</strong>.
