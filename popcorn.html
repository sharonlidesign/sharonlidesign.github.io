          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Popcorn, previously Lunchable, is an early-stage startup that
             helps college students find friends and network by setting
              them up with people of similar interests. Throughout my
               time at Popcorn, I was directly involved in shaping its
                rebrand and launch as a web app that introduces people
                 to others by scheduling virtual group meetups.
                  I worked closely with a fellow UX designer as well as
                   the CEO to create the entire user experience from
                    conception to delivering the final prototype to the
                     engineering team.

      <h4>User Research</h4>

      <h6>
        To better understand the target user, I interviewed 7 college-aged
         students. The interviewees ranged from freshmen to seniors at
          large public universities. I focused on learning about their
           experiences with finding friends online, especially since a lot
            of students have to connect with their classmates solely online
             due to the pandemic.

            Have low expectations for other friend-matching apps because

      <h5>Mapping Out the Flow</h5>

      <h6>Before I started prototyping, I mapped out the task flow.
         I focused on ordering the actions in a way that is intuitive,
          yet it still guides the user enough to alter their behavior,
           namely increasing their likelihood to sign up and show up to
            a meetup.

         feature would look like in order to explore how to approach
          them and organize them into pages that made sense to the user.

        I decided to go with <strong>Iteration 3</strong> because it better influences
         the user to attend the meetup as they will <strong>feel like they know the other people better</strong>.
          Overall, this presentation of information is <strong>concise yet comprehensive</strong> in encouraging
           the user to learn about and communicate with their matches.

      <!-- Video Call Iterations -->

      <h5>Providing an Enjoyable Video Call Experience</h5>

      <h6>
        Given that many of the interviewees mentioned how much they <strong>dread awkward
          conversations</strong> during first meetings, I wanted to incorporate some kind of
          <strong>conversation starter</strong> into the video call. Many users said that they <strong>would
            use this feature a lot</strong> during usability testing, further confirming that I
            should include it.

             it easy for the user to find and understand. The conversation starters
              are at the bottom of the page, as to <strong>not obstruct</strong> the user’s view of

        I ended up choosing <strong>Iteration 3</strong> because compared to the others, it best
         allows users to put their <strong>attention on the people</strong> they’re talking to, while

      <h4>Feedback & Usability Testing</h4>

      <h5>Fostering Meetup Participation</h5>

      <h6>
        I usability-tested by asking users to go through the whole flow, giving them specific tasks along the way.
        After recieving feedback from users, as well as my team, I made the following changes:
      </h6>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Moved the “Confirm Now” button to a more <strong>visible and prominent position.</strong>
           This would encourage the user to click this button, thus furthering our
            number one goal of increasing meetup participation. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changed the green checkmarks to text because users were <strong>confused</strong> about
            their meaning during usability testing. Now, users can <strong>clearly see which
              people are confirmed</strong> to attend the meetup, which would in turn encourage
              them to confirm as well. 
          </p>
        </li>

            Made the chat notification red in order to make it stand out more, thus

      <h5>Reimagining How Users Connect with Past Meetups</h5>

      <h6>
        I initially designed this page to show a history of the user’s past meetups.
         After recieving feedback, I redesigned it with the following changes:
      </h6>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changed “Past Meetups” page into a “Chats” page replacing the meetup
            cards with chats. This would make it more accessible and <strong>effortless
             for users to engage with past meetup groups</strong>, thus furthering our goal of
              fostering engagement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Removed the chatbox from the “Upcoming Meetup” page and instead put all
            chats in together in one page in order to create a more <strong>centralized place
             for users to talk to others</strong>. During testing, users also confirmed that this
              format makes them feel more inclined to participate in the group chats. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h4>UI Designs</h4>

    <h5>Redesigning the Profile to be More Engaging</h5>

    <h6>
      I redesigned the profile page to take up more horizontal space,
       to let the user to <strong>see more info without scrolling</strong>. Taking up
        more horizontal space also allows users to immediately see the
         images at the bottom, which add the most personalized touch to
          the profile. Overall, the profile page plays a huge role in
           how users get to know each other before a meetup, so I really
            focused on making it <strong>expressive, yet standardized</strong>.

    <h5>Creating a More Delightful Experience</h5>

    <h6>
      I continued to make other changes to content, colors, and
       typography in order to create a clearer sense of hierarchy and
        visual consistency for the user. In particular, I redesigned the
         UI of the sign up pages to provide a more <strong>delightful experience</strong>
          that communicates a sense of <strong>fun and sociability</strong>.

      <h3>Takeaways</h3>

      <h6>
        Throughout this internship, I gained great insight into how to
        design for increased user engagement. An important design
          consideration for this app was to influence users to be more
          proactive and communicative to the people they meet online,
            so I designed with this goal in mind throughout the entire
            process. I also had a lot of practice communicating my
              design justifications to cross-functional team members
              and received a lot of feedback that helped me make the
                design more engaging and impactful.
